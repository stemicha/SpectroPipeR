Description: a set of R functions that facilitate a comprehensive, fully automated, and standardized data analysis of Spectronaut DIA-MS data. This includes ID rate summary, ON/OFF analysis, normalization, batch or covariate adjustment,iBAQ and maxLFQ quantification, multivariate analysis, peptide-centric statistical analysis (ROPECA or modified t-test), and interactive HTML report generation. The output is presented through a variety of clear graphs and tables in a well-structured folder system. The comprehensive standalone HTML report is extremely useful for existing Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELN) or Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) to quickly obtain a project-specific overview.
